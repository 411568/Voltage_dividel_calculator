# Voltage_divider_calculator
Author: Krzysztof Sikora

This application is designed to calculate the resistor values from every E-series from E3 to E192 so that the output voltage
of a voltage divider built using those is the closest to the desired one.

Input: 
  - input voltage
  - output voltage
  
Output (for each series):
  - calculated output voltage
  - used resistor values
